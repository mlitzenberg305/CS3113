A cloud rains down kibble for my dog, Xoco.

Originally, I had multiple kibbles come down from the top on the screen 
without the cloud, which is why the code has an array (which is now an
array of one kibble). I couldn't figure out how to make the cloud
consistently rain kibble, so it just pops them out one at a time.
