# CS3113 PROJECT TWO: Pong
In this two player game, the right paddle is moved using the up & down arrow keys
and the left paddle is moved using the W & S keys. Xoco (my dog) runs around in a
random pattern and may deflect the kibble when it collides with him. The game just
ends when the kibble touches either the left or right side of the screen.
