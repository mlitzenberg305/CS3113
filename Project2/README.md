In this two player game, the right paddle is moved using the up & down arrow keys
and the left paddle is moved using the W & S keys. The space bar starts or restarts 
the game. Xoco (my dog) runs around in a random pattern and deflects the kibble
when it collides with him. The game ends when the kibble touches either the left or
right side of the screen, displaying which player has won the game.

Every 5 paddle hits, the level goes up and the speed of the ball increases. Every three
levels, the speed of the paddles increases and Xoco gets the zoomies for the duration 
of that level.

Xoco can be somewhat glitch-y because of the way his random movements are coded,
but generally he moves as he should.
